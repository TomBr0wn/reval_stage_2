                            <p>The GOV.UK Design System website and the codebase it uses, GOV.UK Frontend, is maintained by a team at the Government Digital Service (GDS).</p>
                            <p>This page explains how the team works to ensure the Design System and Frontend are accessible.</p>
                            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Accessibility statement for the GOV.UK Design System website</h2>
                            <p>This accessibility statement applies to the GOV.UK Design System at <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">https://design-system.service.gov.uk/</a>, and the components and patterns from the GOV.UK Frontend codebase
                                which appear in the examples throughout the Design System.</p>
                            <p>The GOV.UK Design System team wants as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
                            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
                                <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                                <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
                                <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
                                <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The team has also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

                            <p>We plan to fix these accessibility issues by the end of June 2021.</p>
                            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How this website has been tested for accessibility</h3>
                            <p>The Design System website was last tested on 7 October 2019. The test was carried out by the <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a>.</p>
                            <p>DAC tested a sample of pages to cover the different content types in the GOV.UK Design System website. They were:</p>
                            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">the homepage</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-working-group">a short content page</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/">a long content page</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/">an overview page</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/">a styles page</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/">a component page</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/">a pattern page</a></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>They also tested the global search functionality that appears in the header of every page in the Design System.</p>
                            <p>The <a href="http://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Frontend documentation website</a> was last tested for accessibility issues in March 2021.</p>
                            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How the GOV.UK Design System team makes this website accessible</h3>
                            <p>The GOV.UK Design System team works hard to ensure that this Design System and Frontend, the codebase it uses, are accessible.</p>
                            <p>Where possible, the team aims to research components and patterns with a representative range of users, including those with disabilities.</p>
                            <p>We also test components to ensure they work with a broad range of browsers, devices and assistive technologies - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools.</p>
                            <p>When we publish new content, we’ll continue to make sure that it meets accessibility standards.</p>
                            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h3>
                            <p>This statement was prepared on 23 October 2019. It was last reviewed on 29 March 2021.</p>
                            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using the Design System and Frontend in your service</h2>
                            <p>While the GOV.UK Design System team takes steps to ensure the Design System is as accessible as possible by default, you still need to carry out contextual research.</p>
                            <p>Using Frontend does not mean your service automatically meets level AA of WCAG 2.1. You’ll still need to make sure your service as a whole meets accessibility requirements.</p>
                            <p>You must research styles, components and patterns as part of your service to ensure that they are accessible in context.</p>

                            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you are not using the Design System and Frontend</h2>
                            <p>The Design System and Frontend were introduced in June 2018 to replace the following deprecated codebases:</p>
                            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li>GOV.UK Elements</li>
                                <li>GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit</li>
                                <li>GOV.UK Template</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The GOV.UK Design System team no longer supports these products and will not be making updates to help them meet level AA of WCAG 2.1.</p>
                            <p>If you’re using these products, you should start <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/updating-your-code/">updating your service to use the Design System and Frontend</a>.</p>
